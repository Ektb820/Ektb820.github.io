<p class="sectionright" style="color:#008080; font-size:14px">I was born on the "Main Line", which includes quite a few towns in the western suburbs of Philadelphia, PA. I graduated from Swarthmore College
with a BA in Chemistry and a minor in Spanish. I subsequently worked in the pharmaceutical industry as a Quality Control Chemist. Yet, I wanted to gain a stronger understanding of public health, so I pursued my
MPH in Sociomedical Sciences from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. During my MPH program I got a lot of exposure to biostatistics. This field really interested me, so I stayed at Columbia
to pursue my DrPH in Biostatistics. Upon graduating from my DrPH program in 2012, I joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor 
at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Currently, I am an Associate Professor in the Center for Biostatistics and Department of Population Health Science and Policy 
at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). I am also the Director of Data Science Training and Enrichment in the 
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.  In the past, I served as the co-Director of the Master of Science in Biostatistics Program and Director of Academic Programs for the Center for 
Biostatistics at ISMMS. I have collaborated on a variety of health disparities-related research projects as well as other types of clinical and translational research projects
 over the course of my career. Feel free to check out some of my <a href="https://plu.mx/mtsinai/u/ebenn?selectedFilterIds=artifactType.countType%3AARTICLE" 
target="_blank" style="color:#FF1493">publications</a>. I have had the pleasure of developing and teaching quite a few courses throughout my career. One course that I am very proud of developing is a graduate-level course, Race and Causal Inference, aimed at increasing 
the methodologic rigor by which we investigate health 
disparities with a goal of finding effective causal targets for intervention.</p>

<p class="sectionright" style="color:#008080; font-size:14px"> I am committed to increasing diversity, inclusion, 
and equitable advancement in (bio)statistics and STEM fields, more broadly, as well as reducing racial/ethnic disparities in faculty promotion 
in academic medicine. I am the co-founder of the NHLBI-funded Biostatistics Epidemiology Summer Training (BEST) Diversity Program and a 
former co-Chair of the ENAR Fostering Diversity in Biostatistics Workshop. I also serve as a mentor for the JSM Diversity Workshop 
and Mentoring Program and the Math Alliance. I was co-PI of the NIGMS-funded Applied Statistics in Biological Systems (ASIBS) Short Course
 aimed at increasing the statistical competency and research capacity of early stage researchers nationwide. If you want to get an introduction to 
biostatistics, you can check out our ASIBS <a href="http://www.asibs-statistics.com/online-lectures" target="_blank" style="color:#FF1493">lectures</a>. I am currently co-PI of the <a href="https://www.creigs.org/" 
target="_blank" style="color:#FF1493">NHGRI-funded Clinical Research 
Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Short Course</a> aimed at exposing doctoral students, 
postdocs, and clinical and research faculty to computational tools in genome science in addition to effective strategies for engaging 
underserved communities in genomics research.</p>

<p class="sectionright" style="color:#008080; font-size:14px">In June 2020, I launched, as Founding Director, the <a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bennlab/" style="color:#FF1493" target="_blank">Center for Scientific Diversity</a> at ISMMS
with a multidisciplinary team of exceptional faculty, staff, and students aimed at increasing the research success and ensuring equitable advancement of underrepresented faculty investigators 
in academic medicine. Additionally, we are committed to increasing representation and retention of underrepresented students in the biomedical research workforce. 
Our Center is unique in that we apply a rigorous, antiracist, research-driven, evidence-based, and culturally competent approach to accomplish these goals. 
I am particularly excited about this new Center as it very much aligns with my research, service, and educational initiatives to date.</p>
   
<p class="sectionright" style="color:#008080; font-size:14px">My contributions to diversity and inclusion in statistics and STEM have been celebrated by various organizations including <a href="https://mathematicallygiftedandblack.com/honorees/emma-benn/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF1493">Mathematically Gifted and Black</a> 
and the <a href="https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/03/01/emma-benn/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF1493">American Statistical Association</a>.</p>
