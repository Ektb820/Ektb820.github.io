    <p style="color:#FF00FF">Thanks for making your way to my website. Briefly, I am a biostatistician who just thought it might be worthwhile creating 
a little website to give you a sense of who I am. I had never met any Black biostatisticians when I started pursuing my doctoral studies in biostatistics. I also didn't meet a Black, female, lesbian biostatistician, like myself, until after I graduated. 
So to all the other Black or female or LGBTQ+ students and professionals in STEM fields, if you are wondering where are the others like you, here I am. And I am one of many many more who are doing everything 
we can to increase the sense of belonging, scientific identity, and success of underrepresented groups in STEM. I want you to know that you will make amazing contributions to science and it is your diversity and brilliance that is going to change the world.
Much respect!
  </p>

<p style="color:#FF00FF">I was born on the "Main Line", which includes quite a few towns in the western suburbs of Philadelphia, PA. I graduated from Swarthmore College
with a BA in Chemistry and a minor in Spanish. I subsequently worked in the pharmaceutical industry as a Quality Control Chemist. Yet, I wanted to gain a stronger understanding of public health, so I pursued my
MPH in Sociomedical Sciences from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. During my MPH program I got a lot of exposure to biostatistics. This field really interested me, so I stayed at Columbia
to pursue my DrPH in Biostatistics. Upon graduating from my DrPH program in 2012, I joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor 
at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Currently, I am an Associate Professor in the Center for Biostatistics and Department of Population Health Science and Policy 
at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). I am also the Founding Director of the <a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bennlab/" 
style="color:#3aae6d;" target="_blank">Center for 
Scientific Diversity</a> and Director of Data Science Training and Enrichment in the 
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.  In the past, I served as the co-Director of the Master of Science in Biostatistics Program and Director of Academic Programs for the Center for 
Biostatistics at ISMMS. I have collaborated on a variety of health disparities-related research projects as well as other types of clinical and translational research projects
 over the course of my career. Feel free to check out some of my <a href="https://plu.mx/mtsinai/u/ebenn?selectedFilterIds=artifactType.countType%3AARTICLE" 
target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">publications</a>. 
I have had the pleasure of developing and teaching quite a few courses throughout my career. One course that I am very proud of developing is a graduate-level course, Race and Causal Inference, aimed at increasing 
the methodologic rigor by which we investigate health 
disparities with a goal of finding effective causal targets for intervention. 
I am committed to increasing diversity, inclusion, 
and equitable advancement in (bio)statistics and STEM fields, more broadly, as well as reducing racial/ethnic disparities in faculty promotion 
in academic medicine. I am the co-founder of the NHLBI-funded Biostatistics Epidemiology Summer Training (BEST) Diversity Program and a 
former co-Chair of the ENAR Fostering Diversity in Biostatistics Workshop. I also serve as a mentor for the JSM Diversity Workshop 
and Mentoring Program and the Math Alliance. I was co-PI of the NIGMS-funded Applied Statistics in Biological Systems (ASIBS) Short Course
 aimed at increasing the statistical competency and research capacity of early stage researchers nationwide. If you want to get an introduction to 
biostatistics, you can check out our ASIBS <a href="http://www.asibs-statistics.com/online-lectures" target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">lectures</a>. I am currently co-PI of the <a href="https://www.creigs.org/" target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">NHGRI-funded Clinical Research 
Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Short Course</a> aimed at exposing doctoral students, 
postdocs, and clinical and research faculty to computational tools in genome science in addition to effective strategies for engaging 
underserved communities in genomics research. My contributions to diversity and inclusion in statistics and STEM have been celebrated by 
various organizations including <a href="https://mathematicallygiftedandblack.com/honorees/emma-benn/" target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">Mathematically Gifted and Black</a> and the <a href="https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/03/01/emma-benn/" target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">American Statistical Association</a>.</p>

  <p style="color:#FF00FF">When I failed my qualifying exams the first time I took them in my doctoral program, I really thought that was the end of my career as a biostatistician.
Thankfully, I passed them the second time around. So to anyone who thinks that failing is defeat, well, I hope I serve as an example that you will eventually dust yourself off and 
get back up and accomplish some amazing things along the way. Anyway, you can find most of my accomplishments to date listed in my <a href="C:\Users\benne03\Documents\PersonalWebsite\EBenn_MSSM_CV_072820_website.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#3aae6d;">CV</a>. I'll do my
best to keep it regularly updated. </p>
